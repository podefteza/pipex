# ðŸ”— pipex

`pipex` is a custom implementation of Unix-like piping, designed to create a pipeline between two commands, emulating a simple shell piping mechanism. This program leverages processes, pipes, and file descriptors for efficient data transfer, allowing two commands to run sequentially, where the output of the first command serves as the input for the second command.

## Overview

The core of `pipex` relies on key Unix concepts:

- **pipe**: creates a one-way communication channel between two processes. It has two ends: one for reading and one for writing.
- **fork:** creates a child process by making an exact copy of the parent process. The child process inherits open file descriptors from the parent, including those for reading and writing. By using `dup2()` in the child process, we can redirect file descriptors to specify where the child reads from or writes to - for instance, redirecting `stdin` to read from the input file or `stdout` to write to a pipe.
- **execve**: runs a command in the process (child or parent) by replacing the current code in that process with the command's code. Once execve is called, the process stops being a copy and becomes the new command, reading from and writing to wherever the file descriptors are directed.

## Installation

Clone the repository and compile the program:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/podefteza/pipex/
cd pipex
make
```

## Usage

The program requires an input file, two commands, and an output file:

```bash
./pipex infile "cmd1" "cmd2" outfile
```
Example:
```bash
./pipex input.txt "ls -l" "grep .c" output.txt
```
If incorrect arguments are provided, pipex will display:
```bash
Usage: ./pipex "infile" "cmd1" "cmd2" "outfile"
```

## Program Details

### Argument and File Checks

- **Argument Count**: If `argc` is not 5, the program exits with an error message.
- **File Checks**:
  - If `infile` doesnâ€™t exist or lacks permission, it opens a null command to simulate no input and allows the program to keep running.
  - If `outfile` doesnâ€™t exist, it creates it with permissions `0666` (all users can read and write but cannot execute).
  - If `outfile` lacks permission, the program exits with `EXIT_FAILURE`.
  - On success, `infile` and `outfile` are opened, and their file descriptors are returned.

### Command Parsing

Commands are parsed into a 2D array using helper functions:

- The command strings are split by spaces to separate the executable and its arguments.
- If quotes are detected, the quotes are removed, and arguments are joined accordingly.

**Example**:
```c
./pipex "infile" "ls -l" "grep 42" "outfile"

commands[0][0] = ls;
commands[0][1] = -l;
commands[1][0] = grep;
commands[1][1] = 42;
commands[2][0] = NULL
```
```c
./pipex "infile" "cat" "awk '{count++} END {printf \"my count: %i\", count}'" "outfile"
commands[0][0] = cat
commands[1][0] = awk
commands[1][1] = {count++} END {printf "my count: %i", count}
```


### Path Search

The program searches for the command path with `find_command`:

- `cmd_is_path`: Checks if the command is given as an explicit path.
- `get_path_from_env`: Retrieves paths from the environment variable `PATH`.
- `search_in_path`: Iterates through each path directory to locate the command.
- `build_path`: Constructs the full path for the command.

If the cmd1 isn't found, the program keeps executing, and only if the cmd2 isnâ€™t found, the program stops with an error message and exits.

### Process Forking and Execution

`pipex` creates a pipe and forks two child processes:

1. **First Process**:
   - Reads from `infile` and writes to the pipe.
   - Duplicates `infile` to `STDIN_FILENO` and the pipeâ€™s write end to `STDOUT_FILENO`.
   - Executes the command if found, replacing the current process with `execve`.

2. **Second Process**:
   - Reads from the pipe and writes to `outfile`.
   - Duplicates the pipeâ€™s read end to `STDIN_FILENO` and `outfile` to `STDOUT_FILENO`.
   - Executes the command similarly to the first process.

Finally, the program closes pipes, waits for processes to complete, and returns the exit status.

### Error Handling

- Displays error messages for file or permission issues.
- Handles cases where commands are not found by checking command paths and arguments.
- Exits with an appropriate status, including handling cases where both commands are invalid.
